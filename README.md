Safety and well being being the need of the hour, motivated us to take up this domain of crime against women streamlining it to target and do comparitive study with alcohol consumption.

Using our knowledge of data analytics and machine learning we are trying to decipher statistics for each district and a few states based on 
input value. 

The Alcohol consumption dataset reviews how the rural and urban areas are specifically affected by it. 

Our concluson is reflected in our inference.

Our reason for choosing Knn alogrithm was because it provided the most accurate values for our training dataset.
